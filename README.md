# Project-13: Register & Login Form  
**By Codesphered01010**

## Description  
This project implements a basic **Register & Login System** using Python's `tkinter` module for the GUI. It stores user credentials in a local text file (`users.txt`) and allows users to register a new account or log in with existing credentials.  

---

## Features  

1. **User Registration**  
   - Users can register by entering a username and password.  
   - If the username already exists, the system will prevent duplicate registration.  

2. **User Login**  
   - Users can log in using their registered credentials.  
   - If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.  

3. **Password Visibility Toggle**  
   - Users can show or hide their password while typing.  

4. **File-Based Credential Storage**  
   - User credentials are stored securely in a local text file (`users.txt`).
